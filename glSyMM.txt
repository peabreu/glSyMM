glSyMM pretends to be a point symmetry display system. Its main purpose is to
identify (using as back-end SyMM) the point group of a molecule and to perform
the symmetry operations on the molecule.

    - Inversion on the symmetry center: atoms move from a position the
    "inverted" position; atoms should be partially transparent; same velocity
    for all atoms ?; representation of the inversion center ?

    - Rotation around one axis; the axis is drawn and the rotation occurs;
    Differentiate the rotation axis from the others (thicker maybe);

    - Reflection; atoms should be partially transparent; representation of the
    mirror plane ? I think a "mirror" larger than the each of the larger
    coordinates in each direction (a constant percentage 12%) is a good idea;

    - Improper rotation; apply each of the last two

During these operations all of the usual movements should be allowed (rotation,
translation and also scaling) should be allowed; define colours to atoms (see
IUPAC recomendation on this; write MODULE for name, atomic symbol, van der Waals
radius, colour;
