glSyMM pretends to be a point symmetry display system. Its main purpose is to
identify (using as back-end SyMM) the point group of a molecule and to perform
the symmetry operations on the molecule.

    - Inversion on the symmetry center: atoms move from a position the
    "inverted" position (x,y,z) --> (-x,-y,-z)

    - Rotation around one axis; the axis is drawn and the rotation occurs.

    - Reflection on a mirror plane.

    - Improper rotation: a combination of the above two operations
