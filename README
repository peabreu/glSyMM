This is just my first attempt to write a program in fortan 90 and openGL.
This started as a way to escape writing my phd thesis ... but it grew and grew
until this. I have been working in this thing for almost two years now, and it
is almost complete. Of course i think the whole show would benefit from a
rewrite from scratch, and someday i will do that, but for now it surves MY
purposes beautifully.
